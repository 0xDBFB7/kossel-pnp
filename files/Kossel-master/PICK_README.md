The following changes have been made to this Marlin:

 - Make fan commands act immediately by adding the line st_synchonize() (thanks https://github.com/celer/picktor)!
 - Make extruder axis rotate nozzle head one complete rotation per mm.
 - Disable cold extrusion error.
 - Disable extrusion length error.
